# mxnet-website-artifacts
This repository manages changes to static artifacts for the MXNet website.

If you would like to modify or add artifacts, please submit a pull request with your proposed changes. When adding a new artifact version, all website content should be under the directory `/versions/x.y.z` where the release version is x.y.z (e.g. 1.5.0).
